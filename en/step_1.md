+ You can create blocks that have 'gaps' to add data. These 'gaps' are called __parameters__. To add parameters, click on the options below to choose the type of data you want to add. Then give your data a name, and click **OK**.

+ You can then define your new block, and use the data by dragging the circular blocks to use them in your code.

+ Use the new `define` block with the gaps you have filled in by attaching code to it and adding it to your script.
